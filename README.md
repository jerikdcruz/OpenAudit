# OpenAudit

## About the repository

This repository contains the beta version of OpenAudit, an open data initiative aiming to make publicly-available audit reports more tractable for use by academic/policy researchers and public-interest audiences using NLP and machine learning methods, starting with the the universe of audit reports of the Philippine government's Commission on Audit. Here, we focus on a subset of these reports both in terms of coverage as well as content to provide a proof-of-concept of the planned broader dataset and platform. 

## Background of OpenAudit

In several developing democracies around the world, government audit institutions regularly publish audit and financial reports that track government bodies’ decisions in raising, budgeting, spending, and managing public resources on behalf of their citizens. These publicly-available reports contain data of immense value to governance researchers and ordinary citizens— potentially offering ways to track government decisions, processes, and behaviors related to corruption, accountability, and state capacity at levels of detail currently unavailable in commonly-used governance indicators, but generally remain underused by academics, policy researchers, and the general public alike. 

OpenAudit leverages advances in optical character recognition, NLP, and machine learning techniques to make these audit reports more ready-for-use for these audiences as well as public-interest watchdogs and reformers. Apart from processing these reports into more structured datasets that will be showcased on dedicated platforms, the project establishes partnerships to ensure the validity of resulting data and its integration with ready user communities.
