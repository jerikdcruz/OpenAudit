# OpenAudit: advancing governance research and accountability with NLP-processed audit reports

## About the repository

This repository contains the beta version of OpenAudit, an open data initiative aiming to make publicly-available audit reports more tractable for use by researchers and public-interest audiences using NLP and machine learning methods, starting with the the universe of audit reports of the Philippine government's [Commission on Audit (COA)](https://www.coa.gov.ph/). Here, we focus on a subset of these reports in terms of coverage and content to provide a proof-of-concept of the planned broader dataset and platform. 

## Background and Context

In developing democracies around the world, government audit institutions regularly publish audit and financial reports that track government bodiesâ€™ decisions in raising, budgeting, spending, and managing public resources on behalf of their citizens. These publicly-available reports contain data of immense value to governance researchers and ordinary citizens; they potentially offer ways to track government decisions, processes, and behaviors related to corruption, accountability, and state capacity at levels of detail currently unavailable in commonly-used governance indicators. Until the present, however, generally remain underused by academics, policy researchers, and the general public alike. 

OpenAudit leverages advances in optical character recognition, NLP, and machine learning techniques to make these audit reports more ready-for-use for these audiences as well as public-interest watchdogs and reformers. Apart from processing these reports into more structured datasets that will be showcased on dedicated platforms, the project establishes partnerships to ensure the validity of resulting data and its integration with ready user communities. 

## Data for this beta version

For the pilot phase of OpenAudit, the team has been provided digital copies of all COA audit reports from 1998 to 2022. While this bigger corpus of reports is undergoing processing, this beta version of OpenAudit showcases what can be learned from these reports by focusing on the executive summaries of audit reports for Philippine local governments. Like the audit reports themselves, these executive summaries are fairly standardized in what they report, having sections dedicated to financial and operational highlights, auditors' opinions on financial statements, audit findings and recommendations, and government units' progress on implementing on the past year's audit recommendations. The randomly-selected executive summary of [Babatngon municipality](https://www.coa.gov.ph/download/3322/leyte/42439/babatngon-executive-summary-2015.pdf) in Leyte province for 2015 provides an illustrative example of the information that is conveyed by such documents. 

In all, we use 17,392 audit reports executive summaries spanning the universe of Philippine local governments for 2010-2020. Within these executive summaries, we zero-in on the "Audit Findings and Recommendations" sections, as these summarize the main issues flagged by auditors in their assessments of agencies' public finances.
