# Setting up the extraction model

Before running the script in `extraction1.R`, make sure to download the executive summaries as stored in the [Allfiles](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cSb7x4-Vg4AEJZAljkMk0qtf7hrAdfir?usp=sharing) repository. Compared to the structure of the folder presented in the `README.md` file, the executive summaries have been unnested in the `Allfiles` version for greater ease in data cleaning operations.
